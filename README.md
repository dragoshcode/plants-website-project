# Minimalist Ecommerce Plant Website

## Build with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript

### Features of this project:

- Responsiveness
- Grid
- Mobile first workflow

### I have practiced JavaScript a lot in this project and have implemented many interactive components (dark mode toggle, accordion)
### So it was an amazing experience for me and was my start with JS ecosystem & and also I have practiced working more with Git by writing more descriptive commit and more of them as a whole
